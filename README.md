100 Days of UI Challenge... not done in 100 days.


Hi my name is ***Seth Duncan*** and I am a Senior Engineer currently employed at ServiceNow. I wanted to work on my craft as a Front-end Developer with the classic 100 days of UI challenge, but unfortunately I have a job and family that takes up most of my day. While I still wanted to continuously improve my skillset, I decided I would still work on the challenges, but this might take me a lot longer. 

What you will see here is a combination of different types of solutions utilizing different technologies. Thoe will include:

* Vue
* React
* CSS/SASS 
* REST API 
* GraphQL 
* And maybe something I decide to try that day...


Feel free to drop me a line with any questions/comments on my Twitter @SethDuncan, and if you see something you want to use in your solution ***GO FOR IT!*** This is meant as a playground for me to try new things, with some small amount of structure, but if something I have here fits what you are looking for, even better.

Thanks for checking out my work and ***Enjoy!***
